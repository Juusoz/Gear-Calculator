	This is a calculator for figuring out what types of gears you need for your project. The original page was created by <a href="https://planetarygenerator.mateuszdrwal.com">mateuszdrwal</a>. This version includes simple spur gear systems and planetary gears.

	<b>Things to keep in mind:</b>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		To generate the gears, you can use an online or local generators. I highly recommend the <a href="https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=9029586664984391977&appLang=en&os=Win64">Helical Gear Generator add-in</a> by Ross Korsky if you are using Fusion 360. Or if you are using something else and don't mind paying a little, <a href="https://geargenerator.com/beta/">geargenerator.com</a> by Abel Vincze.

	<li>
		The module has to be the same for all gears in a layer. 
	</li>
	<li>
		If you are using this calculator to create helical gears make sure to use the radial system, otherwise, you will have to divide the "Planet distance from center" by the cosine of the helix angle for it to be correct.
	</li>
	<li>
		After you have created your 3 gears and have the planet meshing with both the sun and ring gear and you create a circular pattern you will often have to rotate the other planets to make them mesh. do this by rotating the planet by a multiple of the angle shown by the calculator. For example, if you have a planetary with 3 planets and a "Rotate planets by multiple of" of 60&#176;, only one of the rotations of the planets in the set 0&#176;, 60&#176;, 120&#176; will make the planet mesh.
	</li>
	<li>
		For compound planetaries, the second stage will have a "Module multiplier". to get the module of the second stages gears, multiply the first stage module of your choice with the module multiplier.
